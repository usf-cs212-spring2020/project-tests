# Project Tests

The project is broken into two separate GitHub repositories and Eclipse Java projects. This is the test repository with the JUnit tests and expected output files.

Everyone will use the same test repository, which may be updated over time by the instructor. You will not have write access to this repository. To make sure you have the latest version of this repository, perform a [git pull](http://wiki.eclipse.org/EGit/User_Guide#Pulling_New_Changes_from_Upstream_Branch) operation before starting work on the project.
